# Transfermarkt Data Extractor
This script is used to extract the details of a squad from Transfermarkt. 

As input, the script requires the link to the club (e.g., https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/luton-town/kader/verein/1031/saison_id/2023/plus/1)

NOTE: it is key for the link to be in the "Detailed" view for the script to work. You will identify this by the link containing the keywords "kader" and "/plus/1".

After you run the script, the squad profile will be printed to screen and to a csv file for easy manipulation.
